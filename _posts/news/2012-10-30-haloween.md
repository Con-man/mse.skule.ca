Hey MSEs, Itâ€™s that time of year again! The common room has been haunted by
skeletons, vampires and ghosts!
What better way to get into the Halloween spirit than to come to the MSE Common Room on October 31st and enjoy some pumpkin carving (12-1pm), candy and baked goods. So dress up and come celebrate from 11-3pm!

All black cats, cowboys, ghosts, bananas, witches and vampires welcome.
