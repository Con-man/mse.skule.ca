The annual Chariot Race is back! This is where all disciplines bring out their respective chariots and try to win the chariot race while trying to disrupt others. Come out and represent MSE tomorrow and destroy the chariots of all the other disciplines tomorrow and tackle everyone in other disciplines! The race takes place at front campus on Jan/12/2011 at 12pm.
