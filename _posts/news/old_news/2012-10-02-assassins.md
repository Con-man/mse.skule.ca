MSE club is holding a department wide Assassins game. All students, and professors are welcome to participate. Sign-ups for the game will take place between October 9th and the 12th with the class reps (who will also announce the rules).

<!-- more -->

The game will begin on October 15th and end on the Halloween, October 31st or until the last person standing.

Come out and participate, you will get to meet and get to know people from different years and maybe your own year in case you already don't.

Unleash your inner Ninja/Assassin! (figuratively) And may the odds be ever in your favor! (sort of...)
