Hey Everyone! 

Winter Town Hall is happening this week!
<br><br>
When: April 1st 9AM-10AM (feel free to drop in!) 
<br><br>
Where: TBD (hoping to book a lecture room) 
<br><br>
What: Town hall is an event where students can come and speak with faculty, and share their concerns comments and questions about all things MSE! It's how we improve our department, so if you've ever found yourself thinking something like "this course would be way better if.." or "I wish they did X for student support" this is a great event to come and share feedback!
