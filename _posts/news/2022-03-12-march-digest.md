BUCKYBALL

MSE Club’s annual dinner dance is set for this Friday, March 18th from 6:00PM-1:00AM at Eglinton Grand, near Eglinton Station. With a theme of Mask-Querade, tickets include a 3-course meal, an open bar (with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks), and a great time!

Please check your emails for the Final Table Seating Plan, and stay tuned for more details to come this week, including information on the menu and schedule.

<br><br>
IMPORTANT ACADEMIC DATES & DEADLINES

Please see below for some important academic dates and deadlines:

General Deadlines:
<br>March 1: Examination timetable for Winter Session (S-session) and Full Session (Y-session)
courses to be posted. <a href="https://portal.engineering.utoronto.ca/sites/timetable/fes.aspx">Here's the full academic schedule.</a>

Enrollment and other Academic Deadlines:
<br>March 14: Last day students can drop Winter Session (S-session) courses without academic
penalty [1]. This includes S-session FAS courses.
<br>March 14: Last day students can withdraw from Winter Semester (S-term) without academic
penalty [1].
<br>March 14: Last day for students to transfer to part-time studies.
<br>March 14: Last day students can apply to re-enroll for the 2022 Fall Term.
<br>March 14: Deadline to designate a Winter Session (S-term) course as an Extra Course [2].

[1] Without academic penalty means that the course will not reflect on your transcript and will not count towards your GPA if you meet the deadline.
<br><br>[2] This is in accordance with a recently approved policy at the Exams Committee. Essentially, "Extra" courses are courses taken beyond your major requirements. These courses are denoted with an "EXT" on your transcript and do not count towards your CGPA. As long as you comply with the respective deadlines, you have the choice of which courses you wish to denote as "Extra".

<br>If you have any academic date related questions, please message Samantha Paradi-Maropakis at samantha.paradimaropakis@mail.utoronto.ca.

COMMON ROOM OPENING

After a long wait, the MSE Undergraduate Common Room will be opening Monday, March 14th!
The Common Room will be open Monday - Friday, 8:00AM - 8:00PM, and is located at WB143. 

To get into the room, you need to get a fob, which can be obtained from Jessica in the MSE Office, WB140, starting from Monday, March 14th, @10:00AM for a $20 Deposit (that you get back when you eventually return the fob).

Only one student can enter the office at a time: if more than one student enters, the office will be closed and fob rentals will be stopped.

How to get there:
<br>If you are entering WB from King's College, walk up the half flight of stairs and the room is at
the end of the hallway to your left.
<br>If you are entering WB from College, take a right down the main WB hallway, and the room is at
the end.
<br>If you are entering WB from St. George, walk down to the end of the main WB hallway.

Rules and restrictions we need to follow:
<br>Masks: Masks must be worn at all times except for when actively eating, which can only be done
at designated eating tables.
<br>Contact Tracing: To be allowed to stay in the common room, you must fill out a contact tracing
form that will be kept at the entrance. You will need to fill out your name, email, and approximate
time of arrival and exit.
<br>UCheck: To be allowed to stay in the common room, you must complete your UCheck before
you enter.
<br>Capacity Limit: There is no capacity limit
<br>Sanitizing: If you are going to be touching a common surface, sanitize your hands before and
after.

<br>
We need to follow these rules, or we won't have a common room anymore. There will be a few random checks every day done by volunteers to make sure everyone has filled out the contact tracing and UCheck, and that masks are being worn when not actively eating.

<br><br>
