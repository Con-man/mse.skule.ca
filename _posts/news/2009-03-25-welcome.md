Hello everyone!

This year the MSE Club was chosen by the Engineering Society to accept the award for Discipline Club of the Year!! Our chair, Karl Visnovec accepted the award last Monday.

On behalf of the MSE Club, we'd like to congratulate and thank Karl for all the hard work and dedication he has put forth into the MSE Club. Starting with common room renovations over the summer, leading up to the chariot race construction in the winter, working out details for MS'E'CE, and of course day-to-day management of the club's business. Congratulations and thank you, Karl!

As the end nears, the MSE Club would like to extend their thanks to all the club executives, departmental support, Engineering Society officers and directors, class representatives, the ECE Club, and many volunteers for helping us put on a great show for 2008-2009! We hope to continue this success in the future and are happy to see a continuous increase in student involvement!
