ACADEMICS UPDATES:

Here are some quick academics updates due to the changing COVID-19 situation. Firstly, if anyone is struggling to get the necessary accommodations (eg. a professor isn’t recording their lectures), please reach out to our Academic Director, Samantha Paradi-Maropakis, or your Year Representative, and they will do their best to help you!

Term Work Petition Information: Currently, medical documentation is NOT required for a term work petition. This means that if you are feeling sick, please stay home and self report that you are sick on ACORN. If you miss out on any assignment marks, participation marks, or any other term marks as a result, you may submit a petition without a doctor’s note to support it. More information is available <a href="https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/petitions/term-work-petitions/">here</a>.

International Students Information/Reopening Information:
According to the faculty, all students should expect to be resuming in-person studies on February 7th, meaning that all students should plan to be in Toronto by this date.


NEW BUCKYBALL UPDATES:

MSE’s annual Dinner Dance, better known as Buckyball, is still set for March 18th at Eglinton Grand! 

We are still planning for it to be in-person, but there is a lot of uncertainty on whether we will be able to host the event, depending on provincial and university guidelines, as well as if it is safe for us to do so. 

More information will come in the following weeks as we get a better idea of the situation. Ticket sales will hopefully begin in February, and refunds will be 100% guaranteed if we are unable to host the event.


MERCH ORDERING FORMS:

If you would like to rep the best discipline there is and look good doing it, MSE merch is available!
Choose from the iconic Home is Wallberg crewnecks, shot glasses, baseball tees, and stickers. The order form is linked <a href="https://forms.gle/B9u7mnRCPcXyDJGd6">here</a>. If you have any merch-related questions, please message Amanda Morelli, our Vice Chair.
