1. WELLNESS REMINDERS
MSE Club would like to encourage and remind all students to take care, both physically and mentally over the break (and during the next semester). Take some time to catch up on some sleep, spend some time outside, do things you enjoy, and reconnect with family and friends! Additionally, our Wellness Flowchart will be available soon on the MSE website. If you're struggling, please reach out for help, as it is always available if you ask. The Good to Talk phone number is included here: 1-866-925-5454.

If you have any merch-related questions, please message Amanda Morelli at amanda.morelli@mail.utoronto.ca.
5. MSE COIN DESIGNS
Please note that all MSE students are welcome to fill out the Graduation Coin form, as the chosen design will be used for years to come.
“Professor Thorpe of the MSE department is looking to bring back handing out graduation coins to the 4th years at convocation, and is looking for our input on the design of these coins. Below are examples of something that the final product might look like, but we're looking for your feedback! Please comment on the below suggestions and what you would like to see in the final design. Note that we'll be getting a professional designer to create the final mockup before creating a mold, so these are all very rough copies. Of note, in order to incorporate as much as possible and make an interesting design, we're looking to create a collage of the different options so please do choose multiple if you think they well represent what MSE involves.”
Please message Andrew Wuebbolt at andrew.wuebbolt@mail.utoronto.ca if you have any questions.
6. BUCKYBALL UPDATES
MSE’s Annual Dinner Dance, better known as Buckyball, is currently set for March 18th, at Eglinton Grand. Information on buying tickets and more details will be available in the new year.
