These wildly exciting get-togethers will be held a couple of times through the year to celebrate important milestones in your university career (end of midterms! Last day of school!). This is a great chance to meet upper years and your fellow classmates (if you haven't already), buy cheap textbooks, get copies of past exams, and most importantly, score free food. Watch out for the upcoming BBQ Book Smoker to be held in the first full week of classes.
