Can you sing? Rap? Dance? Make people laugh? Play an epic tuba solo? Recite all of Shakesphere? If you have any talent and want to show it off, come to Coffee House!
Or watch people you know show off all the mad skillz displayed above. That is also acceptable because nothin quite beats a rap dancing tuba monologue with an assorted serving of coffee and cookies. Tell your non-MSE friends to hang out as well, we love more company!
