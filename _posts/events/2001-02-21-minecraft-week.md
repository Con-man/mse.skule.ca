Take a break from studying and join us on the MSE discord to play some games! 

MSE is running a Minecraft Event this reading week! Anytime from now until Sunday, February 27th, build anything your heart desires (eg. a house, a farm, a redstone contraption, itâ€™s totally up to you!) on your own or with your friends on our MSE Minecraft Server for a chance to get featured. Previous creations you have built on the server may also be submitted. 

Send a screenshot of your creation(s) to us here, or via email to <mse@g.skule.ca>. All submissions will be featured on our MSE Club Instagram account. See below for the server information:
