This is possibly the most highly anticipated MSE event of the year and the one event you shouldn't miss.

MSE Clubâ€™s annual dinner dance is set for March 18th from 6:00PM-1:00AM at Eglinton Grand, near Eglinton Station. With a theme of Mask-Querade, tickets include a 3-course meal, an open bar (with both alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks), and a great time!

Tickets are $80 each and were available until February 25th.

Remember this year if we cannot do the event in-person you will receive a full-refund on your ticket! If we cannot do an in-person event we plan to host Buckyball online on the same date so keep your calendar open!!
