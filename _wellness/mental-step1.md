Remember, any answer is okay!

**Yes, there's something on my mind.**

That’s fair! We're going to do our best to take care of it.

Set a timer for 15 minutes, and work on a solution. If it's something you can change, then great! If not, do your best to reach out to someone and talk about it. If you need help figuring out what resources are available to you as a U of T MSE student, go to the <a href="/links/">Wellness Resources section on our useful links page</a>!

Remember, 15 minutes and only 15! You can go back to whatever it is after we're done working through this together. We're just taking baby steps in the right direction.

**Okay, I did my best. What’s next? (Go to #2)**

***

**No, I don't know the reason.**

Sometimes, we don't know the source of our bad feelings, and that's okay. We're gonna work through this together!
Okay! (Go to #2)
