If you are feeling foggy, you might need some exercise.

**Yes, a walk/ride sounds great.**

Walks/rides are really good for both our bodies and our minds. Take a walk/ride of whatever length you choose! You're not trying to burn calories or get to a particular destination; you're just taking a pleasant jaunt. Enjoy it!

**Okay, I am back from my walk/ride and I'm ready for the next question. (Go to #9)**

**No, a walk/ride would be too much for me.**

If you can't take a walk, that's okay! Here are some alternatives that can get your heart pumping a bit faster:
-   Jumping jacks
-   Bouncing on the bed
-   Dancing
-   Push ups or sit ups, if you like doing them
-   Walking up and down the stairs
-   Yoga
-   Wiggling, squirming, jiggling around; being silly and active and having fun!

If none of those are or seem possible, just sit outside for some fresh air!

**Okay, I did some exercise to the best of my ability. I'm ready for the next question. (Go to #9)**
