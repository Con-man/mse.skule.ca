**No, I'm good. (Go to #9)**

**Yes, there are too many people here, or people I don't feel comfortable with.**

If you can, try to remove yourself from situations that are overwhelming or feel unsafe. If you can't relocate entirely, take frequent breaks, or tune out with headphones.

**I did my best. On to the next step. (Go to #9)**

**I am alone and I don't like it.**

Being alone can feel really scary and unsafe. In reality, if you take basic precautions, you're almost certainly fine! However, getting a friend, making a phone or Skype call, playing with a pet, and/or turning on the TV or music can help.

**I reached out to someone and I'm feeling better. I'm ready for the next step. (Go to #9)**
