**No, I'm not very depressed. (Go to #7)**

**Yes, I'm feeling depressed.**

Feeling depressed isn't fun, but it doesn't last forever! Try your best to not  be mad or disappointed with yourself for feeling depressed, it’s not your fault that your brain is mean to you.

Take 15 minutes and try to accomplish something small. It can be loading the dishwasher, getting a glass of water, or making some cookies.

You are not a failure, and your situation is not hopeless. You are fighting one of the hardest fights out there, and the fact that you’re here, looking for help and pushing through, is a testament to your will and strength. You deserve to feel better, about the world and yourself, even if it doesn't feel like it right now.

**Okay, I've done my best to take care of myself and I'm ready for the next question. (Go to #7)**
