---

Next we're going to deal with other types of physical discomfort you may be in. Is something about your environment distressing or uncomfortable?

**No, it seems fine here to me. (Go to #7)**

***

**Yes, my surroundings are less than ideal.**

Are your surroundings the right temperature?
 -   I'm just right. (Go to #7)
 
 -   **I'm too cold.** If you're too cold, you can try putting on some warm clothes, using a space heater, turning up the heat in your home, putting on a blanket, and/or snuggling with a pet or another person.
 
 -   **I'm too hot.** If you're too hot, you can try putting on cooler clothes, turning on a fan, or turning up the AC in your house. If you are still too warm, try to spritz some cool water or place a moist towel on your face and the inside of any joints (elbows, knees, neck, etc)

**Okay, I fixed it. (Go to #7)**
