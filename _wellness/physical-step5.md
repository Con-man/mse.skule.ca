**No, my body feels fine. (Go to #6)**

**Yes, something hurts.**

If there is something your doctor has prescribed you for pain, you should take it or do it. There is no guilt or shame in asking for medical assistance with your pain, and reducing or eliminating bodily pain will help your ability to deal with other issues.

For aches and pains, take an aspirin, ibuprofen (advil) or acetaminophen (tylenol). You may also want to apply a heating pad or a cold pack on whatever hurts. If you have a stomach ache, there are medications for that, like Pepto Bismol, and hot tea may also help.

Be nice to your body, and try to do "replace" the unpleasant pain with some pleasant alternative sensations, like good smells and pleasurable textures.

**I am as well taken care of as I can manage right now. (Go to #6)**
