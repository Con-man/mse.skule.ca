**No, I feel fine.  (Go to #10)**

***

**Yes, I feel icky, gross, or unclean.** 

Do you have the energy and ability to take a shower?

**Yes, I'll take a shower. (Go to #10)**

No, I need another solution. 

If you are unable to take a shower, here are some things to do instead:
 -   Wash your face
 -   Put on lotion
 -   Change your clothes
 -   Use dry shampoo
 -   Whatever physical self-care activity you like best!
 
**I'm clean and I'm ready for the next step. (Go to #10)**
