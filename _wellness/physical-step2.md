**No, I need to take my meds.**

Medication needs to be taken on schedule, or your body might react negatively.

Take some time now to take any pills, do any tests or injections, or apply any ointments prescribed by your doctor. If this is a persistent problem for you, you may want to set an alarm (on something you keep on your person, i.e. phone, laptop, watch) so you remember to take it at the same time every day.

**Okay, I took my medication. Next question!**
