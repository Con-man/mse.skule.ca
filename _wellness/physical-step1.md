**I could use a snack...**

When you need a snack, just pop some easy food in your mouth. If there's a specific food you want, it's okay to eat it! You don't have to eat perfectly healthy all the time-- no one does! Just also use your brain a little, and notice the quantity you're eating, and how healthy it is for you. You're probably just fine at trusting your gut and knowing what your body needs.

I’ve finished my snack and I’m ready for the next step (Go to #2)

**No, I need a meal.**

You haven't eaten in a little while, and your body needs fuel. It's time for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

**I need some help!**

Making a meal is hard for you right now, and that's okay! Everybody struggles with cooking sometimes

You have some options:
 -   You can cook a meal for yourself.
 -   You might have ready-made meals in the fridge.
 -   You might have a meal plan with the university
 -   You can get take-out or delivery.
 -   You can go to a restaurant.

Take-out, delivery, and restaurants are a little more expensive than cooking on your own, but how you spend your money is your decision. It's okay to treat yourself! If you’re looking for cheaper local restaurants near campus, you can find a list of suggested places here.
