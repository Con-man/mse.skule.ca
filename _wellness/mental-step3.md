year: 2
title: 3. Let’s try some grounding activities.
---

Here’s some suggestions:
-   Take deep, calm breaths. Try to pay attention to the rhythm of breathing in… and out.

-   Notice your surroundings. Is there anything interesting? See if you can list 5 things you see, 4 things you hear, 3 things you can feel/touch, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste (saliva is an acceptable answer for the last one).

-   Expose yourself to strong, pleasant sensations, like a pleasing smell or a favorite blanket.

-   Say out loud your name, your age, the date, and your location. List some things you've done today (i.e. getting out of bed, talking to a friend, doing homework, etc. Nothing is too “small” of a task!)

-   Splash water on your face or run your hands under the faucet.

-   Do a body scan meditation, or pay close attention to each of your body parts one by one. See if you can tense up each body part/limb for a few seconds before completely relaxing it or wiggling said limb around a bit!

-   Make tea or hot cocoa or any other calming warm drink. Feel the warmth of it in your hands, and the taste as you sip it slowly. 

-   Listen to music! Can you pick out any specific parts you like the best?

-   Play a categories game; alternatively, name some types of dogs, or clothing items, or gemstones, or countries, or anything else you can think of. See how many you can name before you run out!

-   Write in your journal.
-   Take a mindful walk, either inside or outside. Pay close attention to your body and your surroundings. Can I suggest paying a quick visit to Queen’s park?

-   Squiggle. Wiggle around. Dance. Stretch. Be silly and active for a few minutes. Don’t worry about others right now, the people in Eng have definitely seen much weirder.

-   Any other favorite grounding technique you've heard of or can think of. There's nothing wrong with experimenting!

**Okay! I did one or more of these things, and I'm ready to move on. (Go to #4)**
