Do you feel triggered? Are you having flashbacks? Is something traumatic or upsetting from the past weighing on your mind? Did you have a vivid nightmare?

**No, I'm not feeling triggered. (Go to #5)**

***

**Yes, I feel triggered.**

If you're feeling triggered, see if there's a practical action you can take to lessen your distress. It doesn’t have to solve or “fix” everything, but something small like blocking an unsafe person from your social media, might help you feel more secure.

If not, reach out and tell someone safe how you're feeling. Just express yourself! Human contact works wonders when you're not feeling well emotionally.

If you can’t think of anyone to talk to, try the first floor of Student Services’s Health and Wellness (between Bahen and the Bookstore). They often have someone free who is willing to listen without judgement and offer possible solutions. 

Alternatively, if you prefer a more digital approach, you can always text CONNECT to 686868, without data and completely free of charge (in Canada) or call Good2Talk 24/7 at 1-866-925-5454 to talk to a trained responder who’s here to listen.

Remember that you're here in the present, and nothing from your past can hurt you. If you like, you may want to try some grounding exercises to reinforce that idea.
