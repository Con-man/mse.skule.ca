**No, I'm not very lonely. Next question! (Go to #8)**

**Yes, I'm feeling lonely.**

Everybody feels lonely sometimes. If you're feeling lonely, there's ways to reach out to people!

See if you can talk to someone in your house/residence, or call someone on the phone. You can also use texting or social media to speak to someone. You may want to talk about how you're feeling, or you may not, and that’s ok! If you can’t think of anyone in particular, try one of the discipline common rooms, as most have a space to chill and socialize. You can also head to Hart House and see if any of their clubs interest you.

If you’re still feeling lonely and can’t think of anyone to talk to, try the first floor of Student Services’s Health and Wellness (between Bahen and the Bookstore). They often have someone free who is willing to listen without judgement and offer possible solutions. 

Alternatively, if you prefer a more digital approach, you can always text CONNECT to 686868 (without data and completely free of charge in Canada) or call Good2Talk 24/7 at 1-866-925-5454 to talk to a trained responder who’s here to listen.

**Okay, I did my best to take care of myself and I'm ready for the next question. (Go to #8)**
