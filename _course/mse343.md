##### Description

* * *


This is an introductory course on biomaterials from the perspective of surgical implants. The focus is on the fabrication and materials selection of surgical implants and how the human body responds to those implants once in vivo. Basic concepts of cell structure and human immune response are covered. 

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


What does it mean to be biocompatible?
What considerations are necessary for biomaterials?

##### Tips

* * *


  -   Use flashcards or a similar method to become familiar with the large volume of vocabulary.  
  -   Try and keep detailed notes. Concepts introduced early in the semester become absolutely critical in the final weeks of the class.
  -   This course may appear unrelated to materials science at first, but the applications of these basic biology lessons become apparent when body-material interactions need to be considered.
