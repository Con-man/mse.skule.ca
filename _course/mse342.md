##### Description

* * *


This course offers general perspectives on the emerging fields of nanomaterial synthesis and manufacturing. Case studies of nanotechnology will be presented- primarily relating to the development of nano-Ni by our very own Professor Erb!

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


What defines a nanomaterial?
How do we make nanomaterials?
How can we observe nanomaterials?
What are the advantages and disadvantages of nanomaterials?

##### Tips

* * *


  -   The midterms/exam echo the assignments
  -   Try and relate the concepts of this course to Phase Transformations—they work on the same idea of energy-controlling microstructure.

##### Useful resources

* * *


 - The course slides—Erb’s slides are fairly comprehensive
