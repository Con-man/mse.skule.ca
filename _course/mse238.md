##### Description

* * *


Divided into two sections, this course will cover essential statistics and numerical methods topics. The statistics portion covers probability, distributions, hypothesis testing, regression, and other basic statistics principles. Numerical methods will cover techniques to numerically solve problems in calculus and differential equations, by hand and through the use of MATLAB.

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


How can we test if our hypothesis is correct?
What are the ways to solve calculus questions without computing them?
How can we predict the outcome of an event?

##### Tips

  -   Professor Singh likes to ensure that everyone in the class understands everything in the lecture and is willing to slow down.  So if you are confused, ask him to clarify the topic.
  -   Try and do as many of the assigned questions as you can.  
  -   The MSE lab and ECF labs have MATLAB installed but itâ€™s really helpful to get it on your laptop as well.
  -   Like any coding language, practice is necessary.  
  -   Do not delay or procrastinate the final coding project.
