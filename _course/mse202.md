##### Description

* * *


This course actually answers the question, "Why does anything happen in the universe?"  Before you answer '42', I will save you the trouble.  The answer is, 'To lower the Gibb's Free Energy'.  Now, if you already knew that from other courses, don't fear.  You don't spend the entire semester doing just that.  Thermodynamics deals with all of the nitty-gritty details of chemical equilibrium. It may feel like this course has no overarching ideas, but try to keep sight of the bigger picture - Gibbs Energy.

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


What factors are present that determine whether a process can ever start?  
What does it mean to be energetically favorable?  
How can we design reactions to maximize efficiency? What considerations do we need to make?  
Why/When do reactions happen? 

##### Tips

* * *


  -   Your notes from Physical Chemistry (CHE112) will come in handy here, a good deal of the thermodynamics you learned in that course will be reused here
  -   Try to make sense of derivations (or at least, when to use which equations/how equations connect), and understand how different ideas connect.
