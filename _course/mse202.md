##### Description

* * *


This course actually answers the question, "Why does anything happen in the universe?"  Before you answer '42', I will save you the trouble.  The answer is, 'To lower the Gibb's Free Energy'.  Now, if you already knew that from other courses, don't fear.  You don't spend the entire semester doing just that.  Thermodynamics deals with all of the nitty-gritty details of chemical equilibrium.  

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


What factors are present that determine whether a process can ever start?  
What does it mean to be energetically favorable?  
How can we design reactions to maximize efficiency? What considerations do we need to make?  

##### Tips

* * *


  -   Your notes from Physical Chemistry (CHE112) will come in handy here, a good deal of the thermodynamics you learned in that course will be reused here
