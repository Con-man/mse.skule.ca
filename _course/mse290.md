##### Description

* * *


The goal of this course is that you advance your knowledge of work-related opportunities in Materials Science Engineering and that you communicate this knowledge in oral and written communications to your instructors and peers. You will work in teams of three or four on all assignments except for an individual written analysis or your team’s intermediate presentations. This course is designed to not be heavy in workload; most work can be complete in tutorial.

##### Thematic Questions
