##### Description

* * *


An introduction to topics that span the vast field of materials science.  From crystal structures to phase transformations to materials characterization to materials processing, this course will offer a glimpse and provide a basis of understanding that will carry you through pretty much every course you will study in MSE.

See the <a href="http://courses.skule.ca/anticalendar">F!Rosh Anti-Calendar</a> for more information.

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


How do we go from our idea of atoms in chemistry to the materials we use in our daily lives?  
What simplifications must we make in order to understand how material properties arise?  
What models or machines do we use to "see" things at the level of atoms?

##### Tips

* * *


  -   Use the graphics that are presented (ex. Phase diagrams with pictures of changing crystal structure) to help you remember important processes and steps  
  -   3-D visualization of crystal structures is really helpful in later courses, so use this course as an opportunity to pick up the skill!  
  -   Prof. Ramsay is really easy to talk to, so if you have trouble with the material, make sure to approach him
