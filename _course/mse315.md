##### Description

* * *


This course is designed to teach the fundamental concepts of electrochemistry via the interactions in material-electrolyte systems and their application to the corrosion of materials. You will calculate the thermodynamics of interactions using the Nernst equation, the phase stability of materials using Pourbaix diagrams.The various types of corrosion processes covering all material types are discussed.

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


What are the interactions of material-electrolyte systems and how do they contribute to corrosion processes?
What conditions exacerbate and inhibit corrosion processes?
What methods can be used to prevent the environmental degradation of materials?

##### Tips

* * *


  -   Always get to class on time; otherwise, Thorpe will not let you in.
  -   Know how to draw a Pourbaix diagram and polarization curve; both will be on the final.
