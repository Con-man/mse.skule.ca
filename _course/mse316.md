title: MSE316 - Mechanical Behaviour of Materials
---

##### Description

* * *


This course covers the mechanical behavior of materials with a focus on stress-strain relationships, dislocation theory, strengthening mechanisms, and the processes and mechanisms of elastic, visco-elastic, plastic, and creep deformation. A strong focus is directed at the mechanical behavior of metals.

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


What mechanism governs the deformation of metals?
How are mechanical properties of materials evaluated?
How is mechanical behavior affected by time, temperature, and composition?

##### Tips

* * *


  -   Pay attention during the labs; they are essential to your understanding.
  -   Always go to class and pay attention.
