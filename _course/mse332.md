##### Description

* * *


This course discusses how momentum, heat, and mass are transferred in a given process or system.  This is done by exploring of the Navier-Stokes equation, the heat equation, and the diffusion equation with realistic boundary conditions to model real-world problems in metallurgy and materials processing such as melt cooling. An effective understanding of calculus and partial differential equations is recommended.

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


How can we model momentum, heat, and mass transfer?
What are the engineering challenges for designing materials processes relating to heat and mass transfer?

##### Tips

* * *


  -   Review how to solve integrals and differential equations—it helps you derive the equations that you don’t have memorized!
  -   Know your equations and the conditions in which they apply, there are many subtle variations applied for different situations.
  -   Buy the textbook, read it cover-to-cover, and keep it. It’s that well-written!
  -   Keep a running aid sheet throughout the course as a reference; it will make studying for midterms and exams easier.
