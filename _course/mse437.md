title: MSE437 - Process Metallurgy of Iron and Steel
---

#### Description

***


The course serves as a deep dive into the entire process of iron and steel making. How we transform raw materials into iron, how we can carefully control the compositions to make high grade steels. It focuses on each step of this process from start to finish. 

This course has weekly lectures followed by short tutorial quizzes. The final assessment is a Term Paper/literature review about a suggested topic or a topic of your choice. You also turn the term paper into a short (7-10 minute) in-class presentation in the final week of the term.

##### Thematic Questions

***


What are the basics of iron making, the thermodynamics, reactions, processes. How do we go from raw iron to high grade steels? How can we increase the ecological sustainability of iron and steel making? What steel defects potentially caused the Titanic to sink?


##### Tips

***

- Take full notes during class, the biweekly quizzes follow very closely to what is taught on the slides.
- The quizzes do not require studying anything outside of the slides.

##### Useful Resources
