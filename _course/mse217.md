##### Description

* * *


Despite what CIV100 might have you believe, things are always in motion.  One of the first things you learn about matter is that it is made of atoms in constant motion.  What you don't learn is the result of that motion, and how materials scientists take advantage of that bumping around to do some crazy things.  In Diffusion and Kinetics, we cover two of the most important basic building blocks to understanding materials phenomena: diffusion, the bulk atomic motion of matter due to a concentration gradient and kinetics, the study of the rate at which phenomena on the atomic and molecular level occur.  

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


How do we describe bulk atomic motion in various media?  
What is the difference between thermodynamics and kinetics?  
How do we take advantage of factors affecting the kinetics of a situation?  
 

##### Tips

* * *


  -   understand when the steady state assumption applies and when it doesn't  
  -   drawing a diagram of the system and labelling it with known constants is really useful for more complicated geometries  
  -   determining the order of reaction if possible will make kinetics problems much easier, but also recognize that a lot of problems, especially real ones, will not fit into one of the convenient categories
