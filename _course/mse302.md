##### Description

* * *


This is a continuation of thermodynamics 1, and partially consists of a thorough and more rigorous review of some MSE202 concepts. It goes on to explore Gibbs free energy in more depth, specifically of different types of mixtures. There is also a heavy lab emphasis on FactSage, a thermodynamic modelling software. 

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


When will a mixture occur?
When will a reaction occur?
What is the definition of chemical potential? 
 

##### Tips

* * *


  -   If you get Prof Liu, use his office hours! He is very generous with his time. Also, the notation can get crazy, make sure to pay attention to which symbols mean what.



##### Useful resources

* * *

- Office Hours
- Factsage documentation
