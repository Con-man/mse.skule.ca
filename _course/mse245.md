##### Description

* * *


This course will mirror the style of MSE 244 but will cover Organic Chemistry, arguably on of the most difficult subdisciplines of chemistry. The course begins by working with the basic building blocks of organic compounds: Hydrocarbons, methyl groups, carboxylic acids, thiols etc. You will understand how to name such compounds, how they are formed and how they react with other compounds. The course ends on a few units in polymer chemistry which will lead into polymer courses taken in third and fourth year.

##### Thematic Questions

* * *


How can we predict reaction mechanisms and the product of two organic compounds?
Which polymers are used in everyday life?
How do we synthesize and organic compound

##### Tips

* * *


  -   If this course is usually taught by the same instructor as MSE 244, the tips and tricks of doing well in MSE 244 will carry over in this course
  -   Memorize, practice, memorize and practice some more. Don’t lose easy marks on naming and multiple choice questions.
  -   Past midterms and finals are great practice
