     Hey y'all, I'm Raysa, MSE 2T4! I'm the MSE BOD rep, which basically means I attend the EngSoc board of directors meetings every month so you don't have to. If you have any questions about how EngSoc works, let me know! (even if you just want to know what the heck the officers' jobs are and why they're so important) I am also always down to meet other MSEs MSEs so say hi if you see me around campus :)
